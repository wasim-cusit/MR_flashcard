Front,Back
What is Composer?,"Dependency manager for PHP (like npm for JavaScript), manages libraries/packages"
Installation (Linux/macOS),"curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php; sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer"
Installation (Windows),"Download composer-setup.exe from getcomposer.org and run installer"
Initializing a Project,"composer init - Creates composer.json interactively"
composer.json,"Main configuration file defining dependencies, autoloading, scripts etc."
composer.lock,"Lock file recording exact versions installed (should be committed)"
Basic Install,"composer install - Reads composer.lock (or composer.json) and installs dependencies"
Adding a Package,"composer require vendor/package (e.g., composer require monolog/monolog)"
Removing a Package,"composer remove vendor/package"
Updating Packages,"composer update - Updates all packages to latest versions per composer.json"
Updating Single Package,"composer update vendor/package"
Global Install,"composer global require vendor/package - Installs CLI tools globally"
Autoloading (PSR-4),"'autoload': {'psr-4': {'Namespace\\': 'src/'}} - Maps namespace to directory"
Autoloading (Files),"'autoload': {'files': ['src/helpers.php']} - Load specific files"
Autoloading (Classmap),"'autoload': {'classmap': ['lib/']} - Scan directories for classes"
Dump Autoloader,"composer dump-autoload - Regenerates autoloader after adding classes"
Development Dependencies,"composer require --dev vendor/package (e.g., PHPUnit)"
Platform Packages,"'php', 'ext-*', 'lib-*' - Require PHP version/extensions (e.g., 'php': '^8.1')"
Version Constraints,"^8.1 (8.1.0+ <9.0), ~8.1.2 (8.1.2+ <8.2), 8.1.* (any 8.1.x)"
Exact Version,"'vendor/package': '1.2.3' - Lock to specific version"
Stability Flags,"'@dev', '@alpha', '@beta', '@RC', '@stable' - Control package stability"
Minimum Stability,"'minimum-stability': 'dev' - Allow unstable packages globally"
Repositories,"Custom package sources (VCS, path, artifact, etc.) in composer.json"
Private Repositories,"'repositories': [{'type': 'vcs', 'url': 'git@github.com:user/repo.git'}]"
Packagist,"Default public PHP package repository (packagist.org)"
Running Scripts,"'scripts': {'post-update-cmd': ['npm install']} - Hook into Composer events"
Composer Plugins,"Extend Composer functionality (e.g., prestissimo for parallel installs)"
Outdated Packages,"composer outdated - Shows packages needing updates"
Show Installed,"composer show -i - Lists installed packages"
Package Info,"composer show vendor/package - Shows details about specific package"
Why Package Installed,"composer why vendor/package - Shows which package requires it"
Why Not Package,"composer why-not vendor/package - Shows version conflicts"
Diagnose Issues,"composer diagnose - Checks for common problems"
Clear Cache,"composer clear-cache - Clears Composer's package cache"
Create Project,"composer create-project vendor/package dir - Installs package as new project"
Dry Run,"composer install --dry-run - Simulates install without changing anything"
Prefer Dist,"--prefer-dist - Downloads .zip instead of cloning (faster)"
Prefer Source,"--prefer-source - Clones repository (better for development)"
Optimize Autoloader,"composer dump-autoload --optimize - Generates classmap for production"
No Dev,"composer install --no-dev - Skips development dependencies"
No Scripts,"composer install --no-scripts - Skips post-install scripts"
Interactive Shell,"composer shell - Starts interactive shell with autocomplete"
Security Check,"composer audit - Checks for known vulnerabilities"
Licenses,"composer licenses - Shows licenses of installed packages"
Validate,"composer validate - Checks composer.json for errors"
Self-Update,"composer self-update - Updates Composer itself"
Global Config,"composer config --global - Edits global config (~/.composer/config.json)"
Platform Check,"composer check-platform-reqs - Verifies PHP/extensions match requirements"
Speed Optimization,"COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=0 COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 - Environment vars for large projects"
